    Hello World this website is where to learn and make pizza
    <h3>history</h3>
    Records of pizza-like foods can be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian soldiers of the
    Achaemenid Empire during the rule of Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle
    shields and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese. An early reference
    to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find
    peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal
    that includes round cakes (such as pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that
    these are the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno. In 2023, archeologists discovered a fresco in Pompeii appearing to
    depict a pizza-like dish among other foodstuffs and staples on a silver platter. Italy's culture minister said it "may
    be a distant ancestor of the modern dish". The first mention of the word pizza seemingly comes from a notarial
    document written in Latin and dating to 997 CE from Gaeta, demanding a payment of "twelve pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a
    pork kidney on Christmas Day, and 12 pizzas and a couple of chickens on Easter Day".
    
    Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century. Before that
    time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is uncertain when tomatoes
    were first added and there are many conflicting claims, although it certainly could not have been before the 16th
    century and the Columbian Exchange. Pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries until about 1830, when
    pizzerias in Naples started to have stanze with tables where clients could sit and eat their pizzas on the spot.
    
    A popular legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of
    Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo ('pizza maker') Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the
    visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the
    colors of the Italian flag—red (tomato), white (mozzarella), and green (basil). Supposedly, this type of pizza was then
    named after the queen, with an official letter of recognition from the queen's "head of service" remaining to this
    day on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi.
<H1> now lets make pizza</H1>
<H5>Equipment
Baking Steel
Pizza Peel
Instant Thermometer
Ingredients
Homemade Pizza Dough:
2½ cups (300 g) unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon granulated sugar
½ teaspoon active dry yeast or SAF instant yeast
¾ teaspoon kosher salt
7 ounces (105°F to 115°F) warm water
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
semolina and all-purpose flour for dusting the pizza peel
Pizza Sauce:
1 cup pureed or crushed canned San Marzano tomatoes (or canned Italian plum tomatoes)
2-3 fresh garlic cloves grated with a microplane or pressed
1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil plus more for drizzling
2-3 large pinches of kosher salt to taste
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Toppings:
2-3 tablespoons finely grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese plus more for serving
7 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese (not packed in water) cut into ½-inch cubes
5-6 large fresh basil leaves plus more for garnishing
dried red pepper flakes optional</H5>
<h3>steps</h3>
<h5> step 1 Prepare Pizza Dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Add the warm water
and olive oil, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins to come together. It will seem
shaggy and dry, but don’t worry.</h5>
<br>
<h5>step 2 Scrape the dough onto a well-floured counter top and knead the dough for three minutes. It should quickly come together
and begin to get sticky. Dust the dough with flour as needed (sometimes I will have to do this 2 to 3 times, depending
on humidity levels) – it should be slightly tacky, but should not be sticking to your counter top. After about 3
minutes, the dough should be smooth, slightly elastic, and tacky. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil, and
place the dough into the bowl.
 <br>
 step 3 Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel (or plastic wrap) and allow the dough to rise in a warm, dry area of your kitchen
for 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size. Proofing Tip: If your kitchen is very cold, heat a large heatproof

measuring cup of water in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. This creates a nice warm environment. Remove the cup and
place the bowl with the dough in the microwave until it has risen. </h5>
<br>
<h5> step 4 Preheat Oven and Pizza Steel or Stone: Place the pizza steel (or stone) on the second to top rack of your oven (roughly
8 inches from the broiler element), and preheat the oven and steel (or stone) to 550°F (285°C) for a minumum of 1 hour.
If your oven does not go up to 550°F (285°C) or you are using a delicate pizza stone, I recommend heating it to a
maximum of 500°F (260°C)
 <br>step 5 As the oven is preheating, assemble the ingredients. In a small bowl, stir together the pureed tomatoes, minced garlic,
extra virgin olive oil, pepper, and salt. Set aside another small bowl with the cubed mozzarella cheese (pat the cheese
with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture). Set aside the basil leaves and grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese for
easy grabbing.</h5>
<br>
<h5> step 6 Separate the dough into two equal-sized portions. It will deflate slightly, but that is OK. Place the dough on a large
plate or floured counter top, cover gently with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
step 7
Assemble the Pizza: Sprinkle the pizza peel (if you do not own a pizza peel, you can try using the back of a half sheet
pan - but it is tricky!) with a tablespoon of semolina and dusting of all-purpose flour. Gently use both hands to
stretch one ball of pizza dough into roughly a 10-inch circle (don’t worry if its not perfectly uniform). If the dough
springs back or is too elastic, allow it to rest for an additional five minutes. The edges of the dough can be slightly
thicker, but make sure the center of the dough is thin (you should be able to see some light through it if you held it
up). Gently transfer the dough onto the semolina and flour dusted pizza peel or baking sheet.</h5>

<br>
<h5> step 8 Drizzle or brush the dough lightly (using your fingertips) with olive oil (roughly a teaspoon. Using a large spoon, add
roughly ½ cup of the tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, leaving a ½-inch or ¾-inch border on all sides. Use the back of
the spoon to spread it evenly and thinly. Sprinkle a tablespoon of parmigiano-reggiano cheese onto the pizza sauce. Add
half of the cubed mozzarella, distributing it evenly over the entire pizza. Using your hands, tear a few large basil
leaves, and sprinkle the basil over the pizza. At this point, I’ll occasionally stretch the sides of the dough out a bit
to make it even thinner. Gently slide the pizza from the peel onto the heated baking stone. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or
until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and caramelized and the edges of the pizza are golden brown. Note:
If you're looking for more color, finish the pizza under the low or medium broil setting, but watch it carefully!
Remove the pizza carefully from the oven with the pizza peel, transfer to a wooden cutting board or foil, drizzle the
top with olive oil, some grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, and chiffonade of fresh basil. Slice and serve immediately
and/or prepare the second pizza.</h5>
