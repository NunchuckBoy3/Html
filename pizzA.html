    Hello World this website is where to learn and make pizza
    <h3>history</h3>
    Records of pizza-like foods can be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian soldiers of the
    Achaemenid Empire during the rule of Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle
    shields and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese. An early reference
    to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find
    peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal
    that includes round cakes (such as pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that
    these are the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno. In 2023, archeologists discovered a fresco in Pompeii appearing to
    depict a pizza-like dish among other foodstuffs and staples on a silver platter. Italy's culture minister said it "may
    be a distant ancestor of the modern dish". The first mention of the word pizza seemingly comes from a notarial
    document written in Latin and dating to 997 CE from Gaeta, demanding a payment of "twelve pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a
    pork kidney on Christmas Day, and 12 pizzas and a couple of chickens on Easter Day".
    
    Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century. Before that
    time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is uncertain when tomatoes
    were first added and there are many conflicting claims, although it certainly could not have been before the 16th
    century and the Columbian Exchange. Pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries until about 1830, when
    pizzerias in Naples started to have stanze with tables where clients could sit and eat their pizzas on the spot.
    
    A popular legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of
    Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo ('pizza maker') Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the
    visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the
    colors of the Italian flagâ€”red (tomato), white (mozzarella), and green (basil). Supposedly, this type of pizza was then
    named after the queen, with an official letter of recognition from the queen's "head of service" remaining to this
    day on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi.
