<h5>Adolf Hitler, chancellor and dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945, committed suicide via a gunshot to the head on
30 April 1945 in the Führerbunker in Berlin[a] after it became clear that Germany would lose the Battle of Berlin, which
led to the end of World War II in Europe. Eva Braun, his wife of one day, also committed suicide by cyanide
poisoning.[b] In accordance with Hitler's prior written and verbal instructions, that afternoon their remains were
carried up the stairs and through the bunker's emergency exit to the Reich Chancellery garden, where they were doused in
petrol and burned.[1][2] The news of Hitler's death was announced on German radio the next day, 1 May.[3]

Eyewitnesses who saw Hitler's body immediately after his suicide testified that he died from a self-inflicted gunshot,
presumably to the temple.[c][d][e] Otto Günsche, Hitler's personal adjutant, who handled both bodies, testified that
while Braun's smelled strongly of burnt almonds – an indication of cyanide poisoning – there was no such odour about
Hitler's body, which smelled of gunpowder.[4] Dental remains extracted from the soil in the garden were matched with
Hitler's dental records in May 1945.[5][6][f] The dental remains were later confirmed as being Hitler's.

The Soviet Union restricted the release of information and released many conflicting reports about Hitler's death.
Historians have largely rejected these as part of a deliberate disinformation campaign by Joseph Stalin to sow confusion
regarding Hitler's death,[7][g][h][i] or have attempted to reconcile them.[j] Soviet records allege that the burnt
remains of Hitler and Braun were recovered,[k][l] despite eyewitness accounts that they were almost completely reduced
to ashes. In June 1945, the Soviets began seeding two contradictory narratives: that Hitler died by taking cyanide[m] or
that he had survived and fled to another country.[8][9][10] Following extensive review, West Germany issued a death
certificate in 1956.[11] Conspiracy theories about Hitler's death continue to attract interest.</h5>
