    <H1>Hello World today we will learn about place during WW2</H1>

    Hitler's bunker
   <h5>The Führerbunker German pronunciation:  was an air raid shelter located near the Reich Chancellery in
Berlin, Germany. It was part of a subterranean bunker complex constructed in two phases in 1936 and 1944. It was the
last of the Führer Headquarters  used by Adolf Hitler during World War II.

Hitler took up residence in the Führerbunker on 16 January 1945, and it became the centre of the Nazi regime until the
last week of World War II in Europe. Hitler married Eva Braun there on 29 April 1945, less than 40 hours before they
committed suicide.

After the war, both the old and new Chancellery buildings were levelled by the Soviet Red Army. The underground complex
remained largely undisturbed until 1988–89, despite some attempts at demolition. The excavated sections of the old
bunker complex were mostly destroyed during reconstruction of that area of Berlin. The site remained unmarked until
2006, when a small plaque was installed with a schematic diagram. Some corridors of the bunker still exist but are
sealed off from the public.</h5>
<H3>D-day</H3>
The Normandy landings were the landing operations and associated airborne operations on 6 June 1944 of the Allied
invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during the Second World War. Codenamed Operation Neptune and often referred
to as D-Day (after the military term), it is the largest seaborne invasion in history. The operation began the
liberation of France, and the rest of Western Europe, and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western
Front.

Planning for the operation began in 1943. In the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial
military deception, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied
landings. The weather on the day selected for D-Day was not ideal, and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours; a
further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks, as the planners had requirements for the phase of
the moon, the tides, and time of day, that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable. Adolf Hitler placed
Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in
anticipation of an invasion. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt placed Major General Dwight D. Eisenhower in command of
Allied forces.

The invasion began shortly after midnight on the morning of 6 June with extensive aerial and naval bombardment as well
as an airborne assault—the landing of 24,000 American, British, and Canadian airborne troops. The early morning aerial
assault was soon followed by Allied amphibious landings on the coast of France c. 06:30. The target 50-mile (80 km)
stretch of the Normandy coast was divided into five sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. Strong winds blew the
landing craft east of their intended positions, particularly at Utah and Omaha.

The men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches, and the shore was mined and covered with
obstacles such as wooden stakes, metal tripods, and barbed wire, making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult
and dangerous. The highest number of casualties was at Omaha, with its high cliffs. At Gold, Juno, and Sword, several
fortified towns were cleared in house-to-house fighting, and two major gun emplacements at Gold were disabled using
specialised tanks.

The Allies were able to establish beachheads at each of the five landing sites on the first day, but Carentan, Saint-Lô,
and Bayeux remained in German hands. Caen, a major objective, was not captured until 21 July. Only two of the beaches
(Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five beachheads were not connected until 12 June. German
casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were at least 10,000, with 4,414
confirmed dead.

<h1> the nuking of Japan</h1>
On 6 and 9 August 1945, the United States detonated two atomic bombs over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
respectively. The bombings killed between 150,000 and 246,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and they remain the
only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict. Japan surrendered to the Allies on 15 August, six days after the
bombing of Nagasaki and the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan and invasion of Japanese-occupied Manchuria.
The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on 2 September, effectively ending the war.

In the final year of World War II, the Allies prepared for a costly invasion of the Japanese mainland. This undertaking
was preceded by a conventional bombing and firebombing campaign that devastated 64 Japanese cities, including an
operation on Tokyo. The war in the European theatre concluded when Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945, and the Allies
turned their full attention to the Pacific War. By July 1945, the Allies' Manhattan Project had produced two types of
atomic bombs: "Little Boy", an enriched uranium gun-type fission weapon, and "Fat Man", a plutonium implosion-type
nuclear weapon. The 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces was trained and equipped with the
specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, and deployed to Tinian in the Mariana Islands. The
Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on 26
July 1945, the alternative being "prompt and utter destruction". The Japanese government ignored the ultimatum.

The consent of the United Kingdom was obtained for the bombing, as was required by the Quebec Agreement, and orders were
issued on 25 July by General Thomas T. Handy, the acting chief of staff of the United States Army, for atomic bombs to
be used against Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata, and Nagasaki. These targets were chosen because they were large urban areas
that also held militarily significant facilities. [citation needed] On 6 August, a Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima.
Three days later, a Fat Man was dropped on Nagasaki. Over the next two to four months, the effects of the atomic
bombings killed 90,000 to 166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000 to 80,000 people in Nagasaki; roughly half occurred on
the first day. For months afterward, many people continued to die from the effects of burns, radiation sickness, and
other injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition. Despite Hiroshima's sizable military garrison, most of the dead
were civilians.

Scholars have extensively studied the effects of the bombings on the social and political character of subsequent world
history and popular culture, and there is still much debate concerning the ethical and legal justification for the
bombings. According to supporters, the atomic bombings were necessary to bring an end to the war with minimal casualties
and ultimately prevented a greater loss of life on both sides; according to critics, the bombings were unnecessary for
the war's end and were a war crime, raising moral and ethical implication
